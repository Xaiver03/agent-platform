VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE:
========================
- GitHub repository is correctly updated (verified via git ls-remote)
- Commits are present in remote repository
- Vercel is not detecting changes
- Manual redeploy in Vercel dashboard cannot find these commits

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Check Vercel project settings - verify correct repository connection
2. Check Vercel production branch configuration (should be 'main')
3. Verify Vercel webhook in GitHub repository settings
4. Consider disconnecting and reconnecting Vercel to GitHub
